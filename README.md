# Preact Aria Widgets

Preact props that implement ARIA-compliant widgets in the style of `preact-prop-helpers` (i.e. hooks that return hooks).  **No CSS is provided** &ndash; this library is intended for wiring up event handlers, `aria` attributes, labels, and so on, but each hook gives you the information you need to create appropriate e.g. `class` values to style your own components.

Documentation, testing, production-readiness are all TODO.

Current components:

1. Accordion
2. Button
3. Checkbox
4. Checkbox group (w/ tri-state parent)
5. Dialog (modal)
6. Listbox (single & multi)
7. Menu (w/ menu button)
8. Radio Group
9. Tabs & tab panels
10. Tooltip

Other components (e.g. tree views) are TODO
